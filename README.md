# 2025-CP_Section_Placement_and_Student_Risk_Prediction
The project is entitled Section Placement and Academic Risk Prediction for Incoming Grade 7 students at Zamboanga National High School West, focusing on the development of a web-based machine learning system designed to automate and facilitate the upcoming Grade 7 students' placement into academic programs and sections within Zamboanga National High School West. This system will replace manual, and time-consuming sectioning processes, which usually rely on academic and non-academic metrics and use algorithms for predicting suitable programs for a student. It also includes anomaly detection to mark inconsistent student records, as well as the monitoring module to track the academic performance throughout the school year, which will be predicting at-risk students to facilitate timely interventions.
